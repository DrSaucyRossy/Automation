# Automation
For automating scientific instruments and data analysis using python

Currently the Instruments I have coded for are:

Keithley 2400 to sweep voltage and record the power
Agilent (Now Keysight) 8164A to do a wavelength sweep and record the power

To do's

Fix Agilent code so that the wavelength data is read from the agilent
Merge the two files for detector and modulator measurements
